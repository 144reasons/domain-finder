# domain-finder
Creates a list of domains that use top level domains to form a word. This is really fucked though, needs to have some cleaning up done

I will include instructions on how to use when it isnt 6am

The reason for why all the domains arent altogether in one file is due to there being over 2m domains in this collection, so yeah
